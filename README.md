# One Dollar Board

## What is it?
This ATtiny85 board is a bit different than most. In fact, it is a spiritual successor to the [One Dollar Board](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/one-dollar-board--5/x/14830965#/updates/all) Indiegogo project from 2016. This campaign made more than its goal and failed to deliver. Now, I am much more experienced than I was then. This project is my attempt to bring its idea to fruition.

While I have no where the buisness connections to create a true $1 board, this kit is something you can [buy]() or print yourself!
